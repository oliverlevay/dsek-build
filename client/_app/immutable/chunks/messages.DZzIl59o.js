At LTH, there are eleven guilds, and which guild you belong to depends on what you study. We who study computer science or information and communication technology belong to the D-guild. The guild is involved in everything from study monitoring to organizing the nollning. The guild also organizes parties, study nights, LAN parties, board game nights, badminton, running, volleyball, trips to other universities, a career fair, server tinkering, runs a café, has a football team, a newspaper, develops our own website and an app. The guild has something for most people, and if there's something the guild doesn't do that you think should be done, there's often room to push through your ideas!",jg=()=>"The guild is led by a wonderful group of board members, each responsible for their own area.

För att detta ska vara så enkelt och roligt som möjligt kommer du som n0lla få genomgå en nollning. Nollningen är något av det roligaste som man kan göra i studentlivet, och det kommer ge dig en bra ingång in i ditt nya hem. Det är också det perfekta tillfället att lära känna många nya vänner, både nyantagna studenter och äldre teknologer.<br/><br/>Schemat kommer vara fullspäckat med roliga aktiviteter, sittningar och galenskap. Nollningen kan därför kanske kännas väldigt  intensiv. Detta är inget problem då man väljer helt själv hur mycket av nollningen man vill vara med på!
